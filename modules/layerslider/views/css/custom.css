/*
You can type here custom CSS code, which will be loaded both on your admin and front-end pages. Please make sure to not override layout properties (positions and sizes), as they can interfere with the sliders built-in responsive functionality. Here are few example targets to help you get started:
*/

.ls-container { /* Slider container */

}

.ls-layers { /* Layers wrapper */ 

}

.ls-3d-box div { /* Sides of 3D transition objects */ 

}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p {
	font-family: 'Jost', sans-serif !important;
}
