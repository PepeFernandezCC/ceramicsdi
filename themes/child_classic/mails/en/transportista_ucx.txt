Hello {firstname} {lastname},

Order {order_name} - Carrier Information

The carrier for the delivery of your order with reference {order_name} from {shop_name} is UCX. As soon as the merchandise leaves our facilities, you will receive an email with the tracking number.

It is important to consider the following:

3) The order is delivered curbside; if the pallet jack cannot access your door, it will be unloaded as close as possible.
4) It is highly recommended to contact UCX via mobile number 616281914 (WhatsApp only) to arrange the delivery time. The carrier will do its best to facilitate the delivery process. Please plan your availability to receive the material, either by yourself or the relevant construction professionals, to avoid unsuccessful delivery attempts.
